# Skycond Weather App
## About
This is a user-friendly Android app that provides real-time weather information, including current temperature, weather conditions, feels-like temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and cloud cover percentage. 

Designed using the MVM (Model-View-Model) architecture, the app adheres to clean code principles and integrates with a RESTful API through Retrofit for accurate data retrieval. It also uses SQLDelight for efficient local caching of weather data to improve performance and offline access.
