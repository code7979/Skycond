# Skycond Weather App
## About
This is a user-friendly Android app that provides real-time weather information, including current temperature, weather conditions, feels-like temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and cloud cover percentage. 

Designed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, the app adheres to clean code principles and integrates with a RESTful API through [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for accurate data retrieval. It also uses [SQLDelight](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/2.0.2/android_sqlite/) for efficient local caching of weather data to improve performance and offline access.
